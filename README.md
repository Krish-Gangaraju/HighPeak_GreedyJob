# HighPeak_GreedyJob

I have made a class for each Job with three fields - Start Time, End Time, Profit

I have 2 helper functions, and then the main. Can be run like a normal python file

I tried to comment my code to best explain my thought process

In the video recording, I test out the three sample inputs given and they match the sample outputs given.
